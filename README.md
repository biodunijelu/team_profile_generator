# Team Profile Generator

## Description
This is a command-line application that generates a webpage displaying summaries for a software engineering team. The user can input information about team members, including managers, engineers, and interns, and the application will generate an HTML file that displays each team member's name, role, ID, email, and additional information specific to their role.

The application is built using Node.js and utilizes inquirer for user input and Jest for testing.
